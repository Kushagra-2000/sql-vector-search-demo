# SQL-Vector-Search Solution Accelerator

## Objective

This repository showcases two Streamlit applications that demonstrate how to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions using Azure SQL Database's native vector capabilities and Azure OpenAI. The apps are designed for:
- **Product Review Search**: Upload and semantically search product reviews using CSV data.
- **Resume Matching**: Upload and semantically match resumes using PDF documents.

Both apps allow users to generate embeddings, store/query them in Azure SQL DB, and perform LLM-powered Q&A for intelligent retrieval and recommendations.  
These demo follow the Jupyter notebook provided in the [azure-sql-db-vector-search repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sql-db-vector-search/tree/main) under the Azure-Samples GitHub repo.

## Products & Services Used

- Azure SQL Database (VECTOR data type)
- Azure OpenAI Service
- Azure Document Intelligence (for resume parsing)
- SQL on Fabric *(alternative to Azure SQL DB)*
- Streamlit
- Python (pandas, pyodbc, tiktoken, etc.)

---

## Resources Deployment

### One Click Deployment
Automated deployment scripts are available in a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kushagra-2000/ARM_SQL_OpenAI) that will help to deploy required component.

This includes ARM templates to provision:
- Azure SQL DB
- Azure OpenAI
- Azure Document Intelligence (for resume app)

### Steps to Deploy SQL DB on Fabric
- Create a workspace in Fabric, if not existed before.
- New Item > SQL Database (preview) > Provide DB name > Create

## Run the Application

1. Clone the Repository
2. Navigate to corresponding repository depending upon structured or unstructured dataset.
3. Deploy required resources with one click deployment templates.
4. Install requirements
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run Streamlit App
   ```
   streamlit run <filename.py>
   ```

## What Next?

Once you've successfully deployed and explored the Streamlit applications, here are some next steps to deepen your understanding and expand your solution:

- **Explore the Jupyter Notebook Project**: Visit the companion GitHub repository that includes Jupyter notebooks to:
  - Understand the underlying code and logic behind embedding generation, vector storage, and querying.
  - Experiment with different datasets and prompts.
  - Learn how to customize the pipeline for your own use case.
  - Checkout implementation using Semantic Kernel or LangChain.

- **Dive into Azure Portal**:
  - Monitor and manage your deployed resources.
  - Explore Azure SQL DBâ€™s vector capabilities and performance tuning.
  - Review usage metrics and cost estimations.

- **Customize the Apps**: Modify the Streamlit apps to:
  - Add new data sources (e.g., JSON, web scraping).
  - Enhance the UI/UX for specific business scenarios.
    
- **Build Your Own Use Case**:
  - Use Azure SQL DB or SQL on Fabric as your vector store.
  - Design a RAG solution tailored to your domainâ€”be it legal, healthcare, customer support, or internal knowledge bases.
  - Share your solution with the community.
